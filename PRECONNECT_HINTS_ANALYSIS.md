# Preconnect Hints Performance Analysis

## üìã Executive Summary

**Hypothesis**: Adding preconnect hints for critical 3rd-party domains (Adobe Launch, IMS, Demdex) would reduce connection overhead and improve LCP by 100-200ms.

**Result**: ‚ùå **HYPOTHESIS REJECTED** - Preconnect hints caused a **149% degradation** in LCP (3.9s ‚Üí 9.7s) and a **15-point drop** in Performance Score (83 ‚Üí 68).

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT MERGE** - This approach is counterproductive and should serve as documentation of what NOT to do.

2. **FCP Unchanged**: 
   - Remained at 1.6s
   - Indicates hints don't affect initial paint
   - Resources load too late to benefit

3. **Speed Index Degradation**: 
   - Increased by 1.5s (28% slower)
   - Visual completeness significantly delayed
   - User-perceived performance worse

4. **No CLS Impact**: 
   - Layout stability unchanged
   - Not a layout-related issue

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Timing Issue: Hints Added Too Late ‚è∞

**Problem**: Preconnect hints are added in `scripts.js`, which loads after:
- HTML parsing
- Initial resource discovery
- Critical CSS loading
- Early JavaScript execution

**Impact**: By the time hints are added, browser has already:
- Started discovering Adobe Launch script
- Queued IMS authentication requests
- Begun loading Demdex tracking pixels

**Conclusion**: Preconnect hints are **ineffective** when added via JavaScript. They must be in the initial HTML `<head>`.

---

### 2. Bandwidth Contention on Slow 4G üì∂

**Problem**: Slow 4G has limited bandwidth (~400 Kbps). Adding 4 preconnect operations:

| Operation | Bandwidth Used | Time Cost |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| DNS Lookup (√ó4) | ~2 KB | ~80-200ms |
| TCP Handshake (√ó2) | ~2 KB | ~100-300ms |
| TLS Handshake (√ó2) | ~8 KB | ~200-600ms |
| **Total** | **~12 KB** | **~380-1100ms** |

**Impact**: This 12 KB and 380-1100ms directly competes with:
- LCP image/video (~500 KB)
- Critical CSS (~50 KB)
- Hero JavaScript (~30 KB)

**Result**: LCP resource gets starved of bandwidth, causing massive delay.

---

### 3. CrossOrigin Attribute Mismatch üîê

**Problem**: We used `crossorigin="anonymous"` on preconnect:
```javascript
crossorigin: 'anonymous'
```

**But**: Adobe Launch and IMS scripts may:
- Not use CORS at all
- Use different CORS mode (`use-credentials`)
- Load from different subdomains

**Impact**: 
- Browser opens separate connection pool for CORS vs non-CORS
- Preconnect connection goes **unused**
- Actual requests open **new connections** anyway

**Evidence**: FCP unchanged (early scripts not affected), only LCP degraded (late resources affected by bandwidth exhaustion).

---

### 4. Over-Optimization üéØ

**Problem**: Added 4 resource hints:
- 2 full preconnects (DNS + TCP + TLS)
- 2 DNS prefetches (DNS only)

**Best Practice**: On slow connections, limit to 1-2 CRITICAL preconnects only.

**Impact**: Each additional hint:
- Consumes bandwidth
- Uses TCP/TLS handshake slots
- Competes with actual content

**Recommendation**: If preconnects were needed (they're not in our case), use only:
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://assets.adobedtm.com">
```
No crossorigin, no additional hints.

---

## üìö Lessons Learned

### What We Learned ‚úÖ

1. **Always Measure**: Performance optimizations can backfire
   - Theory: "Preconnect saves connection time"
   - Reality: "Preconnect consumes bandwidth and delays LCP"

2. **Connection Speed Matters**: Optimizations have different effects on different connections
   - Fast connections (fiber, 5G): Preconnects likely help
   - Slow connections (3G, 4G): Preconnects can hurt
   - Lighthouse tests with Slow 4G (realistic for mobile users)

3. **Timing is Critical**: Resource hints only work when added early
   - ‚úÖ Good: In initial HTML `<head>`
   - ‚ùå Bad: Via async JavaScript

4. **Fewer is Better**: On constrained connections
   - Each preconnect has a cost
   - Prioritize ruthlessly
   - When in doubt, leave it out

5. **Test Everything**: Don't assume optimizations help
   - This "optimization" made performance 149% worse
   - Would have shipped if not tested

### What NOT to Do ‚ùå

1. ‚ùå **Don't add preconnects via JavaScript**
   - Too late to be effective
   - Just consumes bandwidth

2. ‚ùå **Don't use crossorigin without verification**
   - Must match actual request CORS mode
   - Mismatch = wasted connection

3. ‚ùå **Don't add multiple preconnects on slow connections**
   - Each consumes limited bandwidth
   - Content suffers

4. ‚ùå **Don't preconnect to resources that load late anyway**
   - Adobe Launch loads at ~500ms (already fast)
   - Not LCP-critical

5. ‚ùå **Don't optimize without measuring**
   - "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"
   - Always test before deploying

## üéØ Alternative Approaches (If Preconnects Were Needed)

### Option 1: Server-Side HTML Injection (Best)

**If** preconnects were beneficial, add them server-side in HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  
  <!-- Add preconnects EARLY, before any scripts -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://assets.adobedtm.com">
  
  <!-- Rest of head -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <script src="scripts.js"></script>
</head>
```

**Pros**:
- Browser sees hints during HTML parsing
- Can establish connections while parsing continues
- Effective for truly early resources

**Cons**:
- Requires server-side rendering or build step
- Adobe EDS may not support this easily

---

### Option 2: Fewer, Better Hints

**If** adding hints at all, use ONLY 1 critical hint:

```javascript
// ONLY if absolutely necessary
const preconnectDTM = createTag('link', { 
  rel: 'preconnect', 
  href: 'https://assets.adobedtm.com'
  // NO crossorigin!
});
document.head.prepend(preconnectDTM); // prepend, not append
```

**Pros**:
- Minimal bandwidth cost
- Single connection for most critical resource
- No crossorigin mismatch

**Cons**:
- Still added via JS (too late)
- Still competes with content
- Marginal benefit at best

---

### Option 3: Don't Use Preconnects (Recommended ‚úÖ)

**Best Approach**: Don't add preconnects at all.

**Rationale**:
- Adobe Launch (96.5 KB) is non-blocking
- IMS (41 KB) loads for logged-in users only
- Demdex (tracking) is low priority
- None are LCP-critical

**Instead**: Focus on:
1. ‚úÖ Optimize LCP resource (hero image/video)
2. ‚úÖ Defer non-critical JavaScript
3. ‚úÖ Lazy load below-fold content
4. ‚úÖ Use proper image dimensions (CLS prevention)

**Evidence**: The `performance` branch achieved:
- LCP: 4.3s ‚Üí 928ms (78% improvement)
- Without ANY preconnect hints!

## üéì Knowledge Transfer

### For Future Engineers

**Question**: "Should we add preconnect hints for 3rd-party scripts?"

**Answer**: **Probably not**, especially if:
1. Scripts load on Slow 4G (mobile users)
2. Scripts are non-blocking (analytics, tracking)
3. Scripts load after LCP
4. You're adding hints via JavaScript (too late)

**Exception**: Preconnects MAY help if:
1. Resource is truly LCP-critical (hero image CDN)
2. Hints are in initial HTML `<head>`
3. Connection is fast (desktop users)
4. You've tested and measured improvement

---

### Testing Checklist

Before deploying ANY performance optimization:

- [ ] Test with Google PageSpeed Insights
- [ ] Test on Slow 4G (realistic mobile)
- [ ] Compare ALL metrics (not just one)
- [ ] Test on multiple pages
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] Document results (even if negative)

---

## üìù Conclusion

**Status**: ‚ùå **DO NOT MERGE**

**Verdict**: Preconnect hints, as implemented, cause significant performance degradation:
- 149% slower LCP
- 18% lower Performance Score
- 28% slower Speed Index

**Root Causes**:
1. Added too late (via JavaScript)
2. Bandwidth contention on Slow 4G
3. CrossOrigin attribute mismatch
4. Over-optimization (too many hints)

**Value**: This branch serves as **documentation** of what NOT to do and reinforces the importance of testing before deploying.

**Recommendation**: Focus on proven optimizations (`performance` branch + CSS Edge Function) that actually improve metrics without side effects.
