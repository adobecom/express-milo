- Hover-based rating interactions
- Timer countdown and auto-submit

**Files:**
- Source: `express/code/blocks/quotes/quotes.js` (469 lines)
- Test: `test/blocks/quotes/quotes.test.js` (562 lines - mostly structure tests)
- Uncovered: ~235 lines (50% of file) - mostly ratings functionality (lines 42-253)

---

### 2. **template-x** (49.5% coverage)

---

### 4. **frictionless-quick-action** (44.23% coverage)
**Why Nala:**
- ❌ Complex user interaction flows
- ❌ Quick action functionality requires real browser context

- Test: `test/blocks/frictionless-quick-action/frictionless-quick-action.test.js` (likely exists)
- Uncovered: ~382 lines (56% of file)

---

### 5. **ckg-link-list** (32.14% coverage)
**Why Nala:**
- ❌ API-dependent (`getData()` from browse-api-controller)
- ❌ Carousel integration (`buildCarousel`)
- ❌ Dynamic button creation based on API response
- ❌ Color sampler visual validation
- ❌ Complex mocking required for unit tests

**Nala Test Coverage Needed:**
- CKG pills display correctly

- Carousel navigation works
- Links navigate correctly
- Empty state handling
- API error handling

**Files:**
- Source: `express/code/blocks/ckg-link-list/ckg-link-list.js` (56 lines - small but API-heavy)

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### When to Use Unit Tests:
✅ Pure functions and utilities  
✅ Simple DOM manipulation  
✅ Edge cases and error handling  
✅ Isolated logic without dependencies  

### When to Use Nala E2E Tests:
✅ API integrations  
✅ Complex user interactions  
✅ Visual validation  
✅ Multi-step workflows  
✅ Authentication/session flows  
✅ Real browser behavior  
✅ Integration between components

## 📝 Notes

- **Overall test health:** ✅ 836 tests passing, 0 failing
- **Test execution time:** ~43 seconds
- **Linting:** Clean (0 errors, 45 warnings - all pre-existing)
- **Branch status:** Ready for PR review

### Lessons Learned:
1. Complex blocks with API dependencies are better suited for E2E testing
2. Unit tests should focus on pure logic and simple edge cases
3. Mocking complex dependencies in unit tests often creates brittle tests
4. Large files (1,000+ lines) typically indicate need for E2E coverage
