# CSS Update Query

When the user asks to optimize variable usage of their files, look at the CSS values that do not use vars. Reference styles.css for
existing vars that match the value EXACTLY and ensure that the var name and the value are semantically similar. For example, do
not use a spacing variable for font sizes and vice versa. Be sure to check font sizes.

**CRITICAL**

Do not replace values with variables unless the value matches the varaible EXACTLY.
