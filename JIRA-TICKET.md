# Jira Ticket: MWPW-XXXXX - Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflows & Documentation

## Summary
Implement comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow improvements including automated PR label management, daily reminders with Star Wars theme, and robust testing infrastructure to streamline development processes.

## Description

### Problem Statement
Our current GitHub Actions workflows lack comprehensive PR management, team communication, and testing infrastructure. This leads to:
- Manual overhead in PR label management
- Lack of visibility into PR status across the team
- Insufficient testing coverage for workflow reliability
- Missing automated reminders for PR review cycles

### Solution Overview
This ticket implements a complete GitHub Actions workflow enhancement package that addresses all identified pain points through automated systems and comprehensive documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ QA Label Management Workflow
- [ ] Automatically adds "Ready for Review" labels to non-draft PRs
- [ ] Removes labels from draft PRs to maintain clean state
- [ ] Sends formatted Slack notifications when PRs become ready for review
- [ ] Supports test mode with `test-ready-for-review-slack` label
- [ ] Integrates Jira ticket extraction and linking in notifications
- [ ] Handles all PR events: opened, edited, ready_for_review, converted_to_draft, labeled, unlabeled, submitted, synchronize, reopened

### ✅ Daily PR Reminder Workflow
- [ ] Runs scheduled reminders at 10 AM and 2 PM PST daily
- [ ] Implements Star Wars themed evening reminders for team engagement
- [ ] Categorizes PRs by review status with priority-based ordering:
  - Changes Requested (Highest Priority)
  - No Approvals (Second Priority)
  - One Approval (Third Priority)
  - Two+ Approvals - Missing QA Label (Fourth Priority)
  - Ready for QA (Fifth Priority)
  - Draft PRs (Lowest Priority)
- [ ] Supports test mode with 5-minute intervals on feature branch
- [ ] Includes all PRs including drafts in comprehensive overview

### ✅ Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Implements multi-layer testing approach:
  - Structure & syntax testing via actionlint
  - YAML schema validation
  - Business logic testing with custom JavaScript
  - Security scanning and dry-run testing
- [ ] Validates all 7 GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Provides comprehensive error handling and logging

### ✅ Comprehensive Documentation
- [ ] Creates detailed workflow documentation with step-by-step guides
- [ ] Includes troubleshooting sections for common issues
- [ ] Provides configuration details and environment variable setup
- [ ] Documents testing procedures for both manual and automated approaches
- [ ] Includes visual flowcharts and examples

## Technical Implementation

   - Check Slack notification sent to test channel

2. **Daily PR Reminder**:
   - Use GitHub Actions UI → "Run workflow" button
   - Select `feature/pr-label-management` branch for test webhook
   - Verify comprehensive PR categorization and Star Wars theme

### Automated Testing
- Workflow linting with actionlint
