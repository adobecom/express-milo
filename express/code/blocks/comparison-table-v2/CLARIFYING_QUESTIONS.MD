1) Headers have no functionality on desktop, should they still have focus states?

2) Design calls for the first row to have a focus state, but the button exists within the first row, so we would have nested controls,
can we remove the focus state?

3) As an aside, be sure to hide columns and headers properly in the mobile version.
